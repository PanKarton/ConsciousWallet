## Q&A or something if anyone wants to read about this project

### What was the context for this project?

This is a first react project made all by myself. Will not be pefect, but its reason to exist is to make me learn how to work alone, read docs and solve
new react problems without any kind of course. My first first flight from the bird's nest. Not sure if that is perfect metaphor but you know what I mean.
Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to add their expenses with categories and display it with charts, day list with calendar and stuff.

### What did you set out to build?

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-6.0` and `redux toolkit`.

### Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?

### What were some unexpected obstacles?
